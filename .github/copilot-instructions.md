# Copilot Instructions for ML_Literacy

## Project Overview
This is a **Zenn publication repository** for machine learning educational content in Japanese. The repository uses `zenn-cli` to manage and preview articles and books published on Zenn.dev platform.

## Content Structure
- `articles/` - Individual Zenn articles (tech blog posts) in Markdown format
- `books/` - Book chapters and collections (currently empty, prepared for future use)
- `images/` - Image assets referenced in articles

## Article Format
All articles follow Zenn's frontmatter convention:
```markdown
---
title: "Article Title in Japanese"
emoji: "ðŸŽ¯"  # Single emoji representing the article
type: "tech"  # or "idea"
topics: [æ©Ÿæ¢°å­¦ç¿’, Python, GoogleColab]  # Array of topic tags
published: false  # true when ready to publish
---
```

## Content Guidelines
- **Language**: All content is written in Japanese, including titles, headings, and body text
- **Target Audience**: Beginners to machine learning, explaining foundational concepts from scratch
- **Style**: Educational and accessible, breaking down complex ML concepts into understandable analogies
  - Examples: comparing digitalization to everyday concepts (colors, sounds, economics)
  - Focus on etymology and conceptual understanding (e.g., "Learning" vs "Studying" in Machine Learning)

## Key Topics Covered
1. **Supervised Machine Learning fundamentals** (`8b954f6e74c773.md`)
   - What "Machine Learning" actually means
   - How data is digitized (text, colors, sounds, economics)
   - Learning vs Studying distinction
   - Historical context (Newton's laws as human "learning")

2. **ML Process and Techniques** (`3f06bfaaf4188b.md`)
   - Data preparation and validation
   - Model selection and parameter tuning
   - Overfitting prevention
   - Cross-validation and ensemble methods

3. **Google Colab & Kaggle Practical Guide** (`c66cb9a66a326b.md`)
   - Google Colab setup and limitations
   - Memory optimization strategies
   - LLM-assisted coding tips
   - Python fundamentals for ML

## Zenn CLI Workflow
```bash
# Preview articles locally
npx zenn preview

# Create new article
npx zenn new:article

# Create new book
npx zenn new:book
```

## File Naming
- Articles use random slugs (e.g., `8b954f6e74c773.md`) generated by Zenn CLI
- Do not rename article files manually - slugs become permanent URLs

## When Editing Articles
- Maintain the educational, beginner-friendly tone
- Keep Japanese language consistency
- Include visual aids and analogies where helpful
- Set `published: false` for drafts, `published: true` only when ready to publish
- Ensure emoji, topics, and type fields are properly set in frontmatter
- Reference images with path `/images/filename.ext`

## Dependencies
- `zenn-cli@^0.2.8` - Official Zenn content management tool
- Node.js required for running Zenn CLI commands
